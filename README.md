# orbdock
A personal docker for ORBSLAM 3, and 3D point map extraction updates 
---
This is a basic docker setup to run experiments on ORBSLAM3, it is largely a variant of the docker developed by [jahanium](https://github.com/jahaniam/orbslam3_docker) and has been largely made with my own machine and data in mind.


You may need to dos2unix the build file.
